# Communication

We have a few communication channels ready to go for you to share with
your community:

 - [The usrse Slack](https://usrse.slack.com) is where we encourage all US-RSEs to join. You can request access by filling out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBQ6AYpYYK2wL21egcaVvH0ZEvtShU-0s-XbqnY3okUsyIZw/viewform).
 - [US-RSE Twitter](https://twitter.com/us_rse) to get updates on social media

The rest is up to you! 

> Hold on, what does that mean?

## Linking to a Known Group

It could be the case that your institution has an established way to create groups of like minded
individuals. At my institution, we have something called "Communities of Practice" where it
was possible to create a definition for the group, and link to the usrse resources. This
can help to further establish validity and trust for your cause.

## Communicating your Cause

Finding the RSEs at your institution, and further, communicating your vision and
initiative to have an RSE community, is no small feat. I would suggest the following points when you
reach out for the first time:

 1. Create your community page prior to contacting anyone so that you can link them to it.
 2. Also describe briefly what an RSE is, and link to documents that might better define the term (e.g., [this one](https://rse.ac.uk/))
 3. For your early contacts, reach out to people and groups that you know. It's easier to be forward and mention that you are just starting the initiative, and are hoping they might participate. 
 4. Tell them what it means to participate, and that they can engage to whatever degree they are comfortable with, including but not limited to:
    - a. Joining the GitHub organization and/or the community repository
    - b. Participating in discussion on the usrse slack channel
    - c. Adding their profile to the community repository with details about support they offer to researchers
    - d. Taking on additional projects that they might think of, and be excited about.
    - e. More extended interaction with the RSE community at community events, calls, etc.
 5. It's also advisable to state your goals, as they might be meaningful for them as well. These might be any or all of the following
    - a. to better establish community for RSEs
    - b. to establish presence that is evidence that there should be more financial support for RSEs at the institution.
    - c. to better connect users with support and services they need for reproducible science 
 6. Finally, ask for their thoughts and feedback. They might have a great idea for a contribution, a new project, or an initiative for your particular community.

## Going Above and Beyond

If your community has several different groups with RSEs, it might be enough to create
unity across groups with the steps above. However, if you want to go above and beyond and
possibly work together, you could consider the following:

 - create a shared GitHub organization to work on code together
 - create a group Twitter for your community
 - have weekly, biweekly, or monthly phone or video calls to discuss collaborations

This scenario is likely more suited to smaller institutions where individuals would
benefit from working together, as opposed to RSEs sitting in separate departments with
already established projects and teams.
