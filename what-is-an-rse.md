# What is an RSE?

RSE stands for "Resarch Software Engineer," and it broadly refers to
a software engineer that specializes in research software. This spans a wide
gamut. Some RSEs are more researchers that do programming, and others are 
trained software engineers that work on research problems. If you identify
as an RSE, regardless of where you fall on this spectrum, you are likely
bringing practices from software development like version control, continuous
integration, and data provenance into workflows to support sustainable software
for research.

## Where do I find RSEs?

RSEs are like granola clusters hiding in a cereal box of flakes. Even if your institution
doesn't have any kind of official RSE community, you will still find RSEs scattered
about the research community as lab research associates, postdocs, staff, and sometimes
even graduate students. They can be found at universities, academic institutions,
national labs, and even companies. Sometimes larger labs can afford to hire staff to exclusively
work on tools, and research computing groups play a role in helping their users
to write code.

However, not all RSEs are hiding. A well established group, the 
[UK Research Software Engineer Association](https://rse.ac.uk/) based in the UK
has existed since (what [appears to be](https://rse.ac.uk/past-committees/)) 2013,
and similar groups can be found in [Germany](https://www.de-rse.org/) and 
the [Netherlands](http://nl-rse.org). The [US-RSE](https://us-rse.org/)
group based in the United States was more recently established.
You'll notice similar branding across these sites, and that is intentional.
These initiatives aim to identify the importance of the RSE for success in
research, and to establish the role as a full fledged professional path.


## What are the types of RSEs?

As mentioned previously, an RSE can range from a researcher that does a lot of
programming, to a software engineer that works in research. While no single RSE
is likely to fall within one subtype, one RSE is likely to have one or more
facets, discussed next.

### Research Software Manager

An RSE Manager is typically the lead of a group of RSEs, with a role that might
be similar to a product manager in a company, or the head of a lab. This individual
usually has expertise in software development, and is a leader not just for the
work of the group, but the individuals in it.

### Domain Developer

It's likely that many RSEs sitting within labs started with or developed
domain knowledge. For example, a researcher developing software for neuroimaging
analysis is likely to be familiar with data formats and software for brain mapping.
The domain developer might sit in a specific department or lab, and work
exclusively on developing and maintaining software for the domain. Usually input,
goals, and feedback would come from the group that the developer serves.

### Researcher

A part of being an RSE might include conducting actual research. It could be
with respect to a domain of science, but it also might be research about
software engineering, open source development, or general practices of
conducting research to begin with.


### Generalist Programmer

In stark contrast, a generalist might assist researchers
with good software development practices without having expertise about
a specific domain. For example, a statistical programmer might hold office hours
and assist researchers from departments across a university. This role can
be viewed as a service, where the programmer has expertise in his or
her practice, and researchers come to him or her to get support.

### Open Source Developer

While a generalist programmer helps researchers with code they are writing, an open source
RSE moves up one level to work on open source software that is valuable for their
user base. The open source RSE must independently seek out or use some other
method to derive what software is valued by their users, and what improvements
are needed.

### Generalist Developer

The RSE developer is by far the most challenging subtype of RSE, as it can be
more disconnected from the user base, and sometimes requires intuition about
what doesn't exist (but might) to improve research sustainability across
groups. A generalist developer does not provide a service for researchers like
the generalist programmer, but instead works on general software that
intuitively could directly or indirectly help researchers.
For example, developing new software that targets metadata provenance or
creation of reproducible containers might not tied to an existing open source
project, and is less likely to be written into a grant and requested by a lab.
However, it would likely benefit researchers across domains, and they won't know
it until the software is available to them.

For all of the above, the margins are not set in stone. For example, this 
author considers herself an open source generalist developer, primarily working
on existing and developing new open source software for research. For more RSE

an RSE.
