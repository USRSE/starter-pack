# Community Portal

The portal is the central location for all of the content that you came up
with in your [plan](plan.md). The guide here will provide steps and a template
to make this easy for you!

## A Little Background

When us-rse first started, it had created a [Slack channel](https://usrse.slack.com) 
along with a [GitHub organization](https://www.github.com/usrse) to serve 
the [main website](https://us-rse.org). As a new RSE in the community
with an institution that I (@vsoch) wanted to bring in, I decided to create
a [community template](https://github.com/USRSE/community-template) that could
easily be populated by an institution. Now, this portal is available to you
to start growing your community.

## Why a portal?

The portal, in and of itself, isn't going to build community. However, by writing
content there for your users, creating guides for best practices, and steps to get support,
the portal helps to establish your group.

## Setup

The details of setup can be found in [the README](https://github.com/USRSE/community-template)
of the respository, and the overall steps are outlined here:

 1. Each interested member of your group can add a personal page that is indexed for search.
 2. If your group has a Twitter feed, it can be added to the site's main page.
 3. You can write an "About" page, and a "Support" page that describes what you offer (also indexed).
 4. If you choose, you can write posts that will appear in the site's feed. You can also add this feed to the main [us-rse blog](https://us-rse.org/blog)


## Branding

By default, the portal is branded to match the main us-rse page. By way of
starting with "community-" it will automatically discovered via the blog.
However, if you want to take extra steps to tweak the theme of the template,
this would strengthen the branding for your particular institution.

## Contact

Make sure to include enough methods of contact on the portal so that if a user
or interested RSE visits, they know how to contact you. By default, if you
add an email address, a contact page is automatically generated
to send an email using formspree. Other social media links like Twitter
and GitHub are good to include, also provided with the template.

## Content

Content is the most important part! It should include most of what you
decided in your [plan](plan.md).

Next, read about [communication](communication.md) to find other RSEs at your institution.
