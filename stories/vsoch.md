# Research Software Engineer

> Stanford University Research Computing

It's hard to not notice that training in computer science has been streamlined to primarily
fill industry-level engineering jobs. In this respect, a degree from a top university in
computer science is a lucrative choice for a young person to make. The path, and resulting
enterprise tools that result from this pipeline are impressive - advances in machine learning,
GPUs, and mobile technologies that are changing the world. However, in this overwhelming positivity,
it's easy to look over the empty space, or specifically, to ask where those same graduates *aren't* going.

I started graduate school in 2011 in the Biomedical Informatics (now Biological Data Sciences) PhD
program at my institution. During my tenure through early 2016, I experienced the unintended
result of having a missing layer of software engineers in academia. Practicing reproducible science,
which on the simplest level is conducting an analysis to answer a scientific question, and
doing it again, was really challenging. It was ironic to me that I was sitting in the crux
of technology and innovation in Silicon Valley, but that the actual practice of research
involving programming and software was at least a decade behind. I also came to realize that 
standard, and elegant practices from software engineering, namely version control, 
testing, standards, and open source development, were all that were needed to solve many 
of these issues. I didn't see job security or even a clearly paved career 
path in front of me, but I decided that the need was dire enough, and inspiring for 
me that I wanted to pursue it. I abandoned a traditional academic route, and turned down
those same industry roles, because I wanted to bring back a layer of missing software engineers 
from academia.

I worked with the head of our Research Computer Center to create a new role
to tackle this problem directly - the first (officially named) Research Software Engineer
at Stanford University. In retrospect we know that there were and continue to be many RSEs
hidden across the university, however they were labeled as other things. A research
software engineer, or "Research Associate" in a lab was not a path that offered 
much in terms of career advancement, salary, or personal growth. I wasn't sure if
I could change that, but the need to work on container technology for reproducible
research was too important to me to think about that. I decided that if I worked my
hardest to solve general problems, I could slowly make change to prove the value
of the role.

With this goal as the prime focus, over the last three years I have realized the power of
open source development. While I am sometimes troubled by a changing open source landscape that
is becoming more corporate controlled, I have not lost sight of what open source culture
has done for researchers. It has been inspiring and powerful, but also served as a driver
for a movement around open science. We were hit with the reproducibility crisis around
2015, and simple platforms like GitHub teaching researchers how to use version control,
continuous integration, and to perform code review helped with the push for open data,
and open code. Personally, open source helped me to grow as a developer. I realized 
that it was more so much more than opening a pull request on Github. It was dually 
thinking about the design of systems, and incentives of the users that flow through them. 
Through interaction with disparate communities, across industry and academia, I've
developed awareness about the sometimes conflicting needs of industry and research,
but also how the two (sometimes very different) beasts can work together.

I consider myself an open source generalist, because I most commonly try to think about
how I want the world to be. I see problems that my users are having, and I want to fix them.
I see a need in an academic community that isn't incentivized to be provided by
industry, and I work on it. I try to work across industry and academic with hopes
that we can help one another. I believe that research software engineers must go beyond 
the expected role of providing a service, and see the next step. 

It's been three years in my current role, and I've (to my own amazement) managed
to keep myself funded. I shouldn't take much credit, because it's also been because of the hard
work of my fearless leader, who has given me a beautiful balance of support and freedom.
My group has hired a second RSE, and he sits with a lab to work exclusively on software
for that lab. While this does not involve me, I see it as tiny progress that
a research software engineer can be a full fledged person at my institution.

I am creating this "starter-pack" as I embark on my own journey to unite the hidden
RSEs at my institution into something that resembles a community. Writing this now,
I don't know exactly how I'll do it - I'm not one to make a robust plan in advance, but
rather someone that just dives in and starts. I want us to be known
so that a researcher that needs help knows exactly where to find it. I want the
role to be better supported and funded by the university, and for the same new 
CS graduates to be able to equally consider an opportunity as an RSE as they would
a role in industry. I want my group, Research Computing, to be more than a service
department, but also involved in the process of research, and allowed
to write grants to secure funding for it. There must be a wider selection of hats
to wear beyond solely a PI, researcher, or teacher. I want all these things but
I am not a manager or a group leader. I can't do many things, and perhaps I'll
never be the best at anything, but I believe that success smells a lot like
hard work. So I'll do that.
