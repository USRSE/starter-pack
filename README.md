# RSE Community Starter Pack

This is a starter pack for bringing together your community of research software
engineers (RSEs) at your institution. Specifically, this is geared toward
individuals that consider themselves Research Software Engineers (but not
managers) and want to create a community. If you are a manager and are looking
to create/hire an RSE community, see [this article](https://rse.ac.uk/resources/how-to-start-an-rse-group/). 
The starter pack here is presented in sections, where each
corresponds with a markdown file in this folder.

## What is an RSE?
To make your case, you will need to have a solid understanding of what an RSE is, different subtypes, and where they might be hiding at your institution. You can read brief bios for RSEs in the [stories](stories/README.md) folder to support these definitions with actual examples. You can also browse the [usrse](https://www.github.com/usrse) community templates to get a sense of what RSEs are working on.

## Find Your RSEs:

How do you find your community? What do you tell them? After you find them, you might even take extra steps like creating a Github organization to collaborate on code, or having meetings and/or video chat.
