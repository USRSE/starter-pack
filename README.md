# RSE Community Starter Pack

This is a starter pack for bringing together your community of research software
engineers (RSEs) at your institution. Specifically, this is geared toward
individuals that consider themselves Research Software Engineers (but not
managers) and want to create a community. If you are a manager and are looking
to create/hire an RSE community, see [this article](https://rse.ac.uk/resources/how-to-start-an-rse-group/). 
The starter pack here is presented in sections, where each
corresponds with a markdown file in this folder.

 - [What is an RSE?](what-is-an-rse.md): To make your case, you will need to have a solid understanding of what an RSE is, different subtypes, and where they might be hiding at your institution. You can read brief bios for RSEs in the [stories](stories) folder to support these definitions with actual examples.
 - [1. Communication](): How do you want to interact with your community? You might choose a simple chat, or create a Github organization to collaborate on code. You might even go as far as to have meetings and/or video chat.
 - [2. Branding]() to make your community cohesive and attractive to both potential members and visiors, creating a community portal with strong branding is important.
 - [3. Contact]() Once you've set up a plan for communication, created a community portal, you are ready to find your fellow RSEs!
